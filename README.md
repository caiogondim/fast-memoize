This library is an attempt to make the **fastest possible memoization library in
JavaScript that supports *N* arguments**.

## Installation

To use the library, install it through [npm](https://npmjs.com)

```shell
npm install fast-memoize --save
```

To port it to Browser or any other (non CJS) environment, use your favorite CJS
bundler. No favorite yet? Try: [Browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[Webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake) or
[Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

## Usage

```js
const memoize = require('fast-memoize')

const fn = function (one, two, three) { /* ... */ }

const memoized = memoize(fn)

memoized('foo', 3, 'bar')
memoized('foo', 3, 'bar') // Cache hit
```

### Custom cache

The fastest cache is used for the running enviroment, but it is possible to
pass a custom cache to be used.

```js
const memoized = memoize(fn, {
  cache: customCache
})
```

The custom cache must implement the following methods:
- `get`
- `set`
- `has`

### Custom serializer

To use a custom serializer:
```js
const memoized = memoize(fn, {
  serializer: customSerializer
})
```

The serializer is a function that receives one argument and outputs a string
that represents it. It has to be a
[deterministic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm)
meaning that, given one input, it always give the same output.

### TTL

To use a time-to-live:
```js
const memoized = memoize(fn, {
  ttl: 100 // ms
})
```

`ttl` is used to expire/delete cache keys. Valid time range up to 24 hours.

Note: cache entries are not groomed aggressively, for performance reasons. So a cache entry may reside in memory for up to `ttl * 2` before actually being purged. However, if a cache entry is accessed anytime after its expiration, it will then be immediately deleted and re-calculated.

## Benchmark
